\title{Simulate diversity outcross pedigree}
\usage{
sim_do_pedigree(ngen = 12, npairs = 30, ccgen = rep(0, npairs),
  nkids_per = 5, design = c("nosib", "random"))
}
\arguments{
\item{ngen}{Number of generations of outbreeding}

\item{npairs}{Number of breeding pairs at each generation}

\item{ccgen}{Vector of same length as npairs, with the number of generations for each CC line}

\item{design}{How to choose crosses: either random but avoiding siblings, or completely at random}
}
\value{
A matrix with six columns: individual ID, mother ID, father
ID, sex, generation, and 1/0 indicator for whether DO or pre-DO.
Founders have \code{0} for mother and father ID. Sex is coded 0 for
female and 1 for male.
}
