## ToDo list for [R/simcross](http://github.com/kbroman/simcross)

- Add convert2genoarray function, giving results like that produced by
  geno2array, but without the loss of phase information. (Also an
  opportunity to work with 3-d arrays in C++.)
- Add tests sim_ril_pedigree, sim_from_pedigree
- how to handle multiple chromosomes?
- convert data to R/qtl cross object
- a bit more detail in the ReadMe
- vignette to describe the basic simulation things
- vignette to describe use of plotting functions
- add more detail to the help info
- Refer to pre-CC probability paper regarding generation numbers and
  how they are different than what's in the output
- document sim_ril and sim_ril8
